# Uber_dataAnalysis_GCP_dataEngineering_project

**Project Overview:**

The Uber Analytics Data Engineering project utilizes Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools and resources to analyze and derive insights from Uber trip data. Leveraging the comprehensive trip records sourced from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission, the project employs Python, Pandas, and Mage for data modeling, transformation, and analysis tasks. By integrating GCP services such as Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery, and Looker Studio, the project creates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline. The goal is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights through interactive dashboards and reports, facilitating data-driven decision-making in the realm of transportation analytics.
